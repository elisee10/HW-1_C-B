Install pynacl and get familiar with generating keys, signing messages, and verifying signatures.
Write up some transactions manually and generate signatures on them using pynacl
Write a single node that reads transactions, mines blocks, and builds its own blockchain.
Update this node to also verify transactions before adding them to its blockchain
Write a driver program that populates a pool of transactions, spins up this one node, waits for it to finish processing, and then exits.
Change the above node to also broadcast blocks that it mines.
Write a node that doesn’t mine transactions on its own, but receives broadcasts and builds its own blockchain from them.
Change the above non-mining node to also verify the broadcasts it receives before it updates its own blockchain (be careful here to ensure that the node can handle forks)
Update your nodes to both mine themselves and check for broadcasts.
Test your setup. Give the nodes a number of invalid transactions that should not be included in a blockchain. Make the transactions invalid for as many different reasons as possible. Do the same for blocks, i.e. have a malicious node that broadcasts invalid blocks (again, in as many different ways as possible), and make sure your honest nodes don’t accept them.
Done!
